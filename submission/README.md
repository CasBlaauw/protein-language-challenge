### Project Description
We are working on the `protein-language` challenge. Our challenge was to predict protein secondary structure features with language models. We have tried out different optimisers and hyperparameters and finally chose AdamW with Learning rate = 0.005 and Weight decay = 0.01 as our winning combo!

To predict using our model, press "Open Application" on the left. 

### Scoreboard
You can track the performance of our predictor in the [challenge scoreboard](https://biolib.com/biohackathon/protein-language-scoreboard/).
